# ZeroDivisionError in Python Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `ZeroDivisionError`. The error occurs when attempting to divide a number by zero.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` presents a solution to handle this issue gracefully.

## Bug
The function `function` in `bug.py` does not handle the case where `b` is zero, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function using a `try-except` block to catch the error and handle it appropriately.
